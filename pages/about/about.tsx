        My journey in web development began in 2022 after graduating from York
        University with a degree in UX Design. Initially, I needed a simple
        portfolio website, which led me to{" "}
        <span className="brightness-150 text-white">explore coding</span>. Since
        then, I&#39;ve worked on various projects, from NFTs to social services
        for non-profits.
      </p>

        Currently, I focus on designing and building{" "}
        <span className="brightness-150 text-white">
          accessible user interfaces
        </span>
        for vulnerable communities. I especially enjoy the intersection of
        design and development.{" "}

        Outside of work, I enjoy running and dancing to stay resilient.
        Occasionally, I take on{" "}
        <a href="https://www.johnjang.ca" className="text-blue-400">
          new design projects
        </a>
        or focus on coding at a local caf√©.
