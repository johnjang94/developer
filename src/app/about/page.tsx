          I am a Canadian who currently resides in Toronto, Ontario, Canada üá®üá¶{" "}
          <br />I enjoy crafting digital experience and building various
          products on the internet. I imagine and design my imagination first,
          then I let it breathe on the internet.
        </p>

          I often heard that I am a creative person, but my true journey with
          design began back in 2021. It was during pandemic and I wanted to seek
          for a new journey away from teaching. This was the moment that
          I&#39;ve encountered UX Design and since then, I have been involved in
          different types of projects from redesign of a web application to a
          mobile design. Perhaps, I wanted to expand my journey a little
          further.

          In 2022, I was exposed to the world of Web Development for the first
          time. I learned the basics of Front-End (from HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript) and have built a few simple projects from making a to-do
          list to a static website. I have continued my journey in learning
          advanced level of web development technology using React, TypeScript,
          Next.js, and Tailwind CSS (for Front-End) as well as MongoDB,
          Express.js, Node.js, and many more (for Back-End).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I have also had a few opportunities to contribute as a
          Front-End Developer in different projects in different communities. I
          was a UI Developer for a blockchain project, a Software Developer for
          an e-commerce project, and a Front-End Developer for a non-profit
          organization. Even though I am a UX Designer, I am dedicated to build
          a good web application to the organizations that need my hands.
